# JavaScript Note

## Data Types

In the previous section, we mentioned a little bit about data types. Data or values have data types. Data types describe the characteristics of data. Data types can be divided into two:

1. Primitive data types
2. Non-primitive data types(Object References)

### Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types in JavaScript include:

1. Numbers - Integers, floats
2. Strings - Any data under single quote, double quote or backtick quote
3. Booleans - true or false value
4. Null - empty value or no value
5. Undefined - a declared variable without a value
6. Symbol - A unique value that can be generated by Symbol constructor

Non-primitive data types in JavaScript includes:

1. Objects
2. Arrays

Now, let us see what exactly primitive and non-primitive data types mean. *Primitive* data types are immutable(non-modifiable) data types. Once a primitive data type is created we cannot modify it.

**Example:**

```
let word = 'JavaScript'
```

If we try to modify the string stored in variable *word*, JavaScript should raise an error. Any data type under a single quote, double quote, or backtick quote is a string data type.

```
word[0] = 'Y'
```

This expression does not change the string stored in the variable *word*. So, we can say that strings are not modifiable or in other words immutable. Primitive data types are compared by its values. Let us compare different data values. See the example below:

```
let numOne = 3
let numTwo = 3

console.log(numOne == numTwo)      // true

let js = 'JavaScript'
let py = 'Python'

console.log(js == py)             //false

let lightOn = true
let lightOff = false

console.log(lightOn == lightOff) // false
```

### Non-Primitive Data Types

*Non-primitive* data types are modifiable or mutable. We can modify the value of non-primitive data types after it gets created. Let us see by creating an array. An array is a list of data values in a square bracket. Arrays can contain the same or different data types. Array values are referenced by their index. In JavaScript array index starts at zero. I.e., the first element of an array is found at index zero, the second element at index one, and the third element at index two, etc.

```
let nums = [1, 2, 3]
nums[0] = 10

console.log(nums)  // [10, 2, 3]
```

As you can see, an array, which is a non-primitive data type is mutable. Non-primitive data types cannot be compared by value. Even if two non-primitive data types have the same properties and values, they are not strictly equal.

```
let nums = [1, 2, 3]
let numbers = [1, 2, 3]

console.log(nums == numbers)  // false

let userOne = {
name:'Asabeneh',
role:'teaching',
country:'Finland'
}

let userTwo = {
name:'Asabeneh',
role:'teaching',
country:'Finland'
}

console.log(userOne == userTwo) // false
```

Rule of thumb, we do not compare non-primitive data types. Do not compare arrays, functions, or objects. Non-primitive values are referred to as reference types, because they are being compared by reference instead of value. Two objects are only strictly equal if they refer to the same underlying object.

```
let nums = [1, 2, 3]
let numbers = nums

console.log(nums == numbers)  // true

let userOne = {
name:'Asabeneh',
role:'teaching',
country:'Finland'
}

let userTwo = userOne

console.log(userOne == userTwo)  // true
```

If you have a hard time understanding the difference between primitive data types and non-primitive data types, you are not the only one. Calm down and just go to the next section and try to come back after some time. Now let us start the data types by number type.

## Numbers

Numbers are integers and decimal values which can do all the arithmetic operations. Let's see some examples of Numbers.

### Declaring Number Data Types

```
let age = 35
const gravity = 9.81  // we use const for non-changing values, gravitational constant in  m/s2
let mass = 72         // mass in Kilogram
const PI = 3.14       // pi a geometrical constant

// More Examples
const boilingPoint = 100 // temperature in oC, boiling point of water which is a constant
const bodyTemp = 37      // oC average human body temperature, which is a constant

console.log(age, gravity, mass, PI, boilingPoint, bodyTemp)
```

### Math Object

In JavaScript the Math Object provides a lots of methods to work with numbers.

```
const PI = Math.PI

console.log(PI)                            // 3.141592653589793

// Rounding to the closest number
// if above .5 up if less 0.5 down rounding

console.log(Math.round(PI))                // 3 to round values to the nearest number

console.log(Math.round(9.81))              // 10

console.log(Math.floor(PI))                // 3 rounding down

console.log(Math.ceil(PI))                 // 4 rounding up

console.log(Math.min(-5, 3, 20, 4, 5, 10)) // -5, returns the minimum value

console.log(Math.max(-5, 3, 20, 4, 5, 10)) // 20, returns the maximum value

const randNum = Math.random() // creates random number between 0 to 0.999999
console.log(randNum)

// Let us  create random number between 0 to 10

const num = Math.floor(Math.random () * 11) // creates random number between 0 and 10
console.log(num)

//Absolute value
console.log(Math.abs(-10))      // 10

//Square root
console.log(Math.sqrt(100))     // 10

console.log(Math.sqrt(2))       // 1.4142135623730951

// Power
console.log(Math.pow(3, 2))     // 9

console.log(Math.E)             // 2.718

// Logarithm
// Returns the natural logarithm with base E of x, Math.log(x)
console.log(Math.log(2))        // 0.6931471805599453
console.log(Math.log(10))       // 2.302585092994046

// Returns the natural logarithm of 2 and 10 respectively
console.log(Math.LN2)           // 0.6931471805599453
console.log(Math.LN10)          // 2.302585092994046

// Trigonometry
Math.sin(0)
Math.sin(60)

Math.cos(0)
Math.cos(60)
```

### Random Number Generator

The JavaScript Math Object has a random() method number generator which generates number from 0 to 0.999999999...

```
let randomNum = Math.random() // generates 0 to 0.999...
```

Now, let us see how we can use random() method to generate a random number between 0 and 10:

```
let randomNum = Math.random()         // generates 0 to 0.999
let numBtnZeroAndTen = randomNum * 11

console.log(numBtnZeroAndTen)         // this gives: min 0 and max 10.99

let randomNumRoundToFloor = Math.floor(numBtnZeroAndTen)
console.log(randomNumRoundToFloor)    // this gives between 0 and 10
```

## Strings

Strings are texts, which are under ***single*** , ***double***, ***back-tick*** quote. To declare a string, we need a variable name, assignment operator, a value under a single quote, double quote, or backtick quote. Let's see some examples of strings:

```
let space = ' '           // an empty space string
let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
let lastName = 'Yetayeh'
let country = 'Finland'
let city = 'Helsinki'
let language = 'JavaScript'
let job = 'teacher'
let quote = "The saying,'Seeing is Believing' is not correct in 2020."
let quotWithBackTick = `The saying,'Seeing is Believing' is not correct in 2020.`
```

### String Concatenation

Connecting two or more strings together is called concatenation. Using the strings declared in the previous String section:

```
let fullName = firstName + space + lastName; // concatenation, merging two string together.
console.log(fullName);
```

```
Asabeneh Yetayeh
```

We can concatenate strings in different ways.

### Concatenating Using Addition Operator

Concatenating using the addition operator is an old way. This way of concatenating is tedious and error-prone. It is good to know how to concatenate this way, but I strongly suggest to use the ES6 template strings (explained later on).

```
// Declaring different variables of different data types
let space = ' '
let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
let lastName = 'Yetayeh'
let country = 'Finland'
let city = 'Helsinki'
let language = 'JavaScript'
let job = 'teacher'
let age = 250

let fullName =firstName + space + lastName
let personInfoOne = fullName + '. I am ' + age + '. I live in ' + country; // ES5 string addition

console.log(personInfoOne)
```

```
Asabeneh Yetayeh. I am 250. I live in Finland
```

### Long Literal Strings

A string could be a single character or paragraph or a page. If the string length is too big it does not fit in one line. We can use the backslash character (\) at the end of each line to indicate that the string will continue on the next line. **Example:**

```
const paragraph = "My name is Asabeneh Yetayeh. I live in Finland, Helsinki.\
I am a teacher and I love teaching. I teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, \
Node.js, Python, Data Analysis and D3.js for anyone who is interested to learn. \
In the end of 2019, I was thinking to expand my teaching and to reach \
to global audience and I started a Python challenge from November 20 - December 19.\
It was one of the most rewarding and inspiring experience.\
Now, we are in 2020. I am enjoying preparing the 30DaysOfJavaScript challenge and \
I hope you are enjoying too."

console.log(paragraph)
```

### Escape Sequences in Strings

In JavaScript and other programming languages \ followed by some characters is an escape sequence. Let's see the most common escape characters:

- \n: new line
- \t: Tab, means 8 spaces
- \\: Back slash
- \': Single quote (')
- \": Double quote (")

```
console.log('I hope everyone is enjoying the 30 Days Of JavaScript challenge.\nDo you ?') // line break
console.log('Days\tTopics\tExercises')
console.log('Day 1\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 2\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 3\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 4\t3\t5')
console.log('This is a backslash  symbol (\\)') // To write a backslash
console.log('In every programming language it starts with \"Hello, World!\"')
console.log("In every programming language it starts with \'Hello, World!\'")
console.log('The saying \'Seeing is Believing\' isn\'t correct in 2020')
```

Output in console:

```
I hope everyone is enjoying the 30 Days Of JavaScript challenge.
Do you ?
Days  Topics  Exercises
Day 1 3 5
Day 2 3 5
Day 3 3 5
Day 4 3 5
This is a backslash  symbol (\)
In every programming language it starts with "Hello, World!"
In every programming language it starts with 'Hello, World!'
The saying 'Seeing is Believing' isn't correct in 2020
```

### Template Literals (Template Strings)

To create a template strings, we use two back-ticks. We can inject data as expressions inside a template string. To inject data, we enclose the expression with a curly bracket({}) preceded by a $ sign. See the syntax below.

Using a string template or string interpolation method, we can add expressions, which could be a value, or some operations (comparison, arithmetic operations, ternary operation).

### String Methods

Everything in JavaScript is an object. A string is a primitive data type that means we can not modify it once it is created. The string object has many string methods. There are different string methods that can help us to work with strings.

1. *length*: The string *length* method returns the number of characters in a string included empty space.

**Example:**

```
let js = 'JavaScript'
console.log(js.length)         // 10
let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
console.log(firstName.length)  // 8
```

1. *Accessing characters in a string*: We can access each character in a string using its index. In programming, counting starts from 0. The first index of the string is zero, and the last index is the length of the string minus one.et us access different characters in 'JavaScript' string.

![https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/raw/master/images/string_indexes.png](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/raw/master/images/string_indexes.png)

```
let string = 'JavaScript'
let firstLetter = string[0]

console.log(firstLetter)           // J

let secondLetter = string[1]       // a
let thirdLetter = string[2]
let lastLetter = string[9]

console.log(lastLetter)            // t

let lastIndex = string.length - 1

console.log(lastIndex)  // 9
console.log(string[lastIndex])    // t
```

1. *toUpperCase()*: this method changes the string to uppercase letters.

```
let string = 'JavaScript'

console.log(string.toUpperCase())     // JAVASCRIPT

let firstName = 'Asabeneh'

console.log(firstName.toUpperCase())  // ASABENEH

let country = 'Finland'

console.log(country.toUpperCase())    // FINLAND
```

1. *toLowerCase()*: this method changes the string to lowercase letters.

```
let string = 'JavasCript'

console.log(string.toLowerCase())     // javascript

let firstName = 'Asabeneh'

console.log(firstName.toLowerCase())  // asabeneh

let country = 'Finland'

console.log(country.toLowerCase())   // finland
```

1. *endsWith*: it takes a substring as an argument and it checks if the string ends with that specified substring. It returns a boolean(true or false).

```
string.endsWith(substring)
```

```
let string = 'Love is the most powerful feeling in the world'

console.log(string.endsWith('world'))         // true
console.log(string.endsWith('love'))          // false
console.log(string.endsWith('in the world')) // true

let country = 'Finland'

console.log(country.endsWith('land'))         // true
console.log(country.endsWith('fin'))          // false
console.log(country.endsWith('Fin'))          //  false
```

1. *search*: it takes a substring as an argument and it returns the index of the first match. The search value can be a string or a regular expression pattern.

```
string.search(substring)
```

```
let string = 'I love JavaScript. If you do not love JavaScript what else can you love.'
console.log(string.search('love'))          // 2
console.log(string.search(/javascript/gi))  // 7
```

1. *match*: it takes a substring or regular expression pattern as an argument and it returns an array if there is match if not it returns null. Let us see how a regular expression pattern looks like. It starts with / sign and ends with / sign.

```
let string = 'love'
let patternOne = /love/     // with out any flag
let patternTwo = /love/gi   // g-means to search in the whole text, i - case insensitive
```

Match syntax

1. *repeat()*: it takes a number as argument and it returns the repeated version of the string.

```
string.repeat(n)
```

```
let string = 'love'
console.log(string.repeat(10)) // lovelovelovelovelovelovelovelovelove
```

# Conditionals

Conditional statements are used for make decisions based on different conditions. By default , statements in JavaScript script executed sequentially from top to bottom. If the processing logic require so, the sequential flow of execution can be altered in two ways:

- Conditional execution: a block of one or more statements will be executed if a certain expression is true
- Repetitive execution: a block of one or more statements will be repetitively executed as long as a certain expression is true. In this section, we will cover *if*, *else* , *else if* statements. The comparison and logical operators we learned in the previous sections will be useful in here.

Conditions can be implementing using the following ways:

- if
- if else
- if else if else
- switch
- ternary operator

### If

In JavaScript and other programming languages the key word *if* is to used check if a condition is true and to execute the block code. To create an if condition, we need *if* keyword, condition inside a parenthesis and block of code inside a curly bracket({}).

```
// syntax
if (condition) {
  //this part of code runs for truthy condition
}
```

**Example:**

```
let num = 3
if (num > 0) {
  console.log(`${num} is a positive number`)
}
//  3 is a positive number
```

As you can see in the condition example above, 3 is greater than 0, so it is a positive number. The condition was true and the block of code was executed. However, if the condition is false, we won't see any results.

```
let isRaining = true
if (isRaining) {
  console.log('Remember to take your rain coat.')
}
```

The same goes for the second condition, if isRaining is false the if block will not be executed and we do not see any output. In order to see the result of a falsy condition, we should have another block, which is going to be *else*.

### If Else

If condition is true the first block will be executed, if not the else condition will be executed.

```
// syntax
if (condition) {
  // this part of code runs for truthy condition
} else {
  // this part of code runs for false condition
}
```

```
let num = 3
if (num > 0) {
  console.log(`${num} is a positive number`)
} else {
  console.log(`${num} is a negative number`)
}
//  3 is a positive number

num = -3
if (num > 0) {
  console.log(`${num} is a positive number`)
} else {
  console.log(`${num} is a negative number`)
}
//  -3 is a negative number
```

```
let isRaining = true
if (isRaining) {
  console.log('You need a rain coat.')
} else {
  console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
}
// You need a rain coat.

isRaining = false
if (isRaining) {
  console.log('You need a rain coat.')
} else {
  console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
}
// No need for a rain coat.
```

The last condition is false, therefore the else block was executed. What if we have more than two conditions? In that case, we would use *else if* conditions.

### If Else if Else

On our daily life, we make decisions on daily basis. We make decisions not by checking one or two conditions instead we make decisions based on multiple conditions. As similar to our daily life, programming is also full of conditions. We use *else if* when we have multiple conditions.

```
// syntax
if (condition) {
     // code
} else if (condition) {
   // code
} else {
    //  code

}
```

**Example:**

```
let a = 0
if (a > 0) {
  console.log(`${a} is a positive number`)
} else if (a < 0) {
  console.log(`${a} is a negative number`)
} else if (a == 0) {
  console.log(`${a} is zero`)
} else {
  console.log(`${a} is not a number`)
}
```

```
// if else if else
let weather = 'sunny'
if (weather === 'rainy') {
  console.log('You need a rain coat.')
} else if (weather === 'cloudy') {
  console.log('It might be cold, you need a jacket.')
} else if (weather === 'sunny') {
  console.log('Go out freely.')
} else {
  console.log('No need for rain coat.')
}
```

### Switch

Switch is an alternative for **if else if else else**. The switch statement starts with a *switch* keyword followed by a parenthesis and code block. Inside the code block we will have different cases. Case block runs if the value in the switch statement parenthesis matches with the case value. The break statement is to terminate execution so the code execution does not go down after the condition is satisfied. The default block runs if all the cases don't satisfy the condition.

```
switch(caseValue){
  case 1:
    // code
    break
  case 2:
   // code
   break
  case 3:
   // code
   break
  default:
   // code
}
```

```
let weather = 'cloudy'
switch (weather) {
  case 'rainy':
    console.log('You need a rain coat.')
    break
  case 'cloudy':
    console.log('It might be cold, you need a jacket.')
    break
  case 'sunny':
    console.log('Go out freely.')
    break
  default:
    console.log(' No need for rain coat.')
}

// Switch More Examples
let dayUserInput = prompt('What day is today ?')
let day = dayUserInput.toLowerCase()

switch (day) {
  case 'monday':
    console.log('Today is Monday')
    break
  case 'tuesday':
    console.log('Today is Tuesday')
    break
  case 'wednesday':
    console.log('Today is Wednesday')
    break
  case 'thursday':
    console.log('Today is Thursday')
    break
  case 'friday':
    console.log('Today is Friday')
    break
  case 'saturday':
    console.log('Today is Saturday')
    break
  case 'sunday':
    console.log('Today is Sunday')
    break
  default:
    console.log('It is not a week day.')
}
```

// Examples to use conditions in the cases

```
let num = prompt('Enter number');
switch (true) {
  case num > 0:
    console.log('Number is positive');
    break;
  case num == 0:
    console.log('Numbers is zero');
    break;
  case num < 0:
    console.log('Number is negative');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('Entered value was not a number');
}
```

### Ternary Operators

Another way to write conditionals is using ternary operators. We have covered this in other sections, but we should also mention it here.

```
let isRaining = true
isRaining
  ? console.log('You need a rain coat.')
  : console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
```

# Arrays

An array is a collection of different data types which are ordered and changeable(modifiable). An array allows storing duplicate elements and different data types. An array can be empty, or it may have different data type values.

### How to create an empty array

In JavaScript, we can create an array in different ways. Let us see different ways to create an array. It is very common to use *const* instead of *let* to declare an array variable. If you ar using const it means you do not use that variable name again.

- Using Array constructor

```
// syntax
const arr = Array()
// or
// let arr = new Array()
console.log(arr) // []
```

- Using square brackets([])

```
// syntax
// This the most recommended way to create an empty list
const arr = []
console.log(arr)
```

### How to create an array with values

Array with initial values. We use *length* property to find the length of an array.

```
const numbers = [0, 3.14, 9.81, 37, 98.6, 100] // array of numbers
const fruits = ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon'] // array of strings, fruits
const vegetables = ['Tomato', 'Potato', 'Cabbage', 'Onion', 'Carrot'] // array of strings, vegetables
const animalProducts = ['milk', 'meat', 'butter', 'yoghurt'] // array of strings, products
const webTechs = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Redux', 'Node', 'MongDB'] // array of web technologies
const countries = ['Finland', 'Denmark', 'Sweden', 'Norway', 'Iceland'] // array of strings, countries

// Print the array and its length

console.log('Numbers:', numbers)
console.log('Number of numbers:', numbers.length)

console.log('Fruits:', fruits)
console.log('Number of fruits:', fruits.length)

console.log('Vegetables:', vegetables)
console.log('Number of vegetables:', vegetables.length)

console.log('Animal products:', animalProducts)
console.log('Number of animal products:', animalProducts.length)

console.log('Web technologies:', webTechs)
console.log('Number of web technologies:', webTechs.length)

console.log('Countries:', countries)
console.log('Number of countries:', countries.length)
```

```
Numbers: [0, 3.14, 9.81, 37, 98.6, 100]
Number of numbers: 6
Fruits: ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon']
Number of fruits: 4
Vegetables: ['Tomato', 'Potato', 'Cabbage', 'Onion', 'Carrot']
Number of vegetables: 5
Animal products: ['milk', 'meat', 'butter', 'yoghurt']
Number of animal products: 4
Web technologies: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Redux', 'Node', 'MongDB']
Number of web technologies: 7
Countries: ['Finland', 'Estonia', 'Denmark', 'Sweden', 'Norway']
Number of countries: 5
```

- Array can have items of different data types

`const arr = [
    'Asabeneh',
    250,
    true,
    { country: 'Finland', city: 'Helsinki' },
    { skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Python'] }
] // arr containing different data types
console.log(arr)`

### Getting array length

Length:To know the size of the array

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(numbers.length) // -> 5 is the size of the array
```

### Getting index an element in arr array

indexOf:To check if an item exist in an array. If it exists it returns the index else it returns -1.

`const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

console.log(numbers.indexOf(5)) // -> 4
console.log(numbers.indexOf(0)) // -> -1
console.log(numbers.indexOf(1)) // -> 0
console.log(numbers.indexOf(6)) // -> -1`

### Converting array to string

toString:Converts array to string

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(numbers.toString()) // 1,2,3,4,5

const names = ['Asabeneh', 'Mathias', 'Elias', 'Brook']
console.log(names.toString()) // Asabeneh,Mathias,Elias,Brook
```

### Joining array elements

join: It is used to join the elements of the array, the argument we passed in the join method will be joined in the array and return as a string. By default, it joins with a comma, but we can pass different string parameter which can be joined between the items.

`const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(numbers.join()) // 1,2,3,4,5

const names = ['Asabeneh', 'Mathias', 'Elias', 'Brook']

console.log(names.join()) // Asabeneh,Mathias,Elias,Brook
console.log(names.join('')) //AsabenehMathiasEliasBrook
console.log(names.join(' ')) //Asabeneh Mathias Elias Brook
console.log(names.join(', ')) //Asabeneh, Mathias, Elias, Brook
console.log(names.join(' # ')) //Asabeneh # Mathias # Elias # Brook

const webTechs = [
  'HTML',
  'CSS',
  'JavaScript',
  'React',

# Functions

A function is a reusable block of code or programming statements designed to perform a certain task. A function is declared by a function key word followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). A parentheses can take a parameter. If a function take a parameter it will be called with argument. A function can also take a default parameter. To store a data to a function, a function has to return certain data types. To get the value we call or invoke a function. Function makes code:

- clean and easy to read
- reusable
- easy to test

A function can be declared or created in couple of ways:

- *Declaration function*
- *Expression function*
- *Anonymous function*
- *Arrow function*

### Function Declaration

Let us see how to declare a function and how to call a function.

```
//declaring a function without a parameter
function functionName() {
  // code goes here
}
functionName() // calling function by its name and with parentheses
```

### Function without a parameter and return

Function can be declared without a parameter.

**Example:**

```
// function without parameter,  a function which make a number square
function square() {
  let num = 2
  let sq = num * num
  console.log(sq)
}

square() // 4

// function without parameter
function addTwoNumbers() {
  let numOne = 10
  let numTwo = 20
  let sum = numOne + numTwo

  console.log(sum)
}

addTwoNumbers() // a function has to be called by its name to be executed
```

```
  function printFullName (){
      let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
      let lastName = 'Yetayeh'
      let space = ' '
      let fullName = firstName + space + lastName
      console.log(fullName)
}

printFullName() // calling a function
```

### Function returning value

Function can also return values, if a function does not return values the value of the function is undefined. Let us write the above functions with return. From now on, we return value to a function instead of printing it.

```
function printFullName (){
      let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
      let lastName = 'Yetayeh'
      let space = ' '
      let fullName = firstName + space + lastName
      return fullName
}
console.log(printFullName())
```

```
  function addTwoNumbers() {
      let numOne = 2
      let numTwo = 3
      let total = numOne + numTwo
      return total

  }

console.log(addTwoNumbers())
```

### Function with a parameter

In a function we can pass different data types(number, string, boolean, object, function) as a parameter.

```
// function with one parameter
function functionName(parm1) {
  //code goes her
}
functionName(parm1) // during calling or invoking one argument needed

function areaOfCircle(r) {
  let area = Math.PI * r * r
  return area
}

console.log(areaOfCircle(10)) // should be called with one argument

function square(number) {
  return number * number
}

console.log(square(10))
```

### Function with two parameters

```
// function with two parameters
function functionName(parm1, parm2) {
  //code goes her
}
functionName(parm1, parm2) // during calling or invoking two arguments needed
// Function without parameter doesn't take input, so lets make a function with parameters
function sumTwoNumbers(numOne, numTwo) {
  let sum = numOne + numTwo
  console.log(sum)
}
sumTwoNumbers(10, 20) // calling functions
// If a function doesn't return it doesn't store data, so it should return

function sumTwoNumbers(numOne, numTwo) {
  let sum = numOne + numTwo
  return sum
}

console.log(sumTwoNumbers(10, 20))
function printFullName(firstName, lastName) {
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`
}
console.log(printFullName('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh'))
```

### Function with many parameters

```
// function with multiple parameters
function functionName(parm1, parm2, parm3,...){
  //code goes here
}
functionName(parm1,parm2,parm3,...) // during calling or invoking three arguments needed

// this function takes array as a parameter and sum up the numbers in the array
function sumArrayValues(arr) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    sum = sum + arr[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    //calling a function
console.log(sumArrayValues(numbers));

    const areaOfCircle = (radius) => {
      let area = Math.PI * radius * radius;
      return area;
    }
console.log(areaOfCircle(10))
```

### Function with unlimited number of parameters

Sometimes we do not know how many arguments the user going to pass. Therefore, we should know how to write a function which can take unlimited number of arguments. The way we do it has a significant difference between a function declaration(regular function) and arrow function. Let us see examples both in function declaration and arrow function.

### Unlimited number of parameters in regular function

A function declaration provides a function scoped arguments array like object. Any thing we passed as argument in the function can be accessed from arguments object inside the functions. Let us see an example

```
// Let us access the arguments object

function sumAllNums() {
 console.log(arguments)
}

sumAllNums(1, 2, 3, 4)
// Arguments(4) [1, 2, 3, 4, callee: ƒ, Symbol(Symbol.iterator): ƒ]
```

```
// function declaration

function sumAllNums() {
  let sum = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
    sum += arguments[i]
  }
  return sum
}

console.log(sumAllNums(1, 2, 3, 4)) // 10
console.log(sumAllNums(10, 20, 13, 40, 10))  // 93
console.log(sumAllNums(15, 20, 30, 25, 10, 33, 40))  // 173
```

### Unlimited number of parameters in arrow function

Arrow function does not have the function scoped arguments object. To implement a function which takes unlimited number of arguments in an arrow function we use spread operator followed by any parameter name. Any thing we passed as argument in the function can be accessed as array in the arrow function. Let us see an example

```
// Let us access the arguments object

const sumAllNums = (...args) => {
 // console.log(arguments), arguments object not found in arrow function
 // instead we use a parameter followed by spread operator (...)
 console.log(args)
}

sumAllNums(1, 2, 3, 4)
// [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

`// function declaration

const sumAllNums = (...args) => {
  let sum = 0
  for (const element of args) {
    sum += element
  }
  return sum
}

console.log(sumAllNums(1, 2, 3, 4)) // 10
console.log(sumAllNums(10, 20, 13, 40, 10))  // 93
console.log(sumAllNums(15, 20, 30, 25, 10, 33, 40))  // 173`
